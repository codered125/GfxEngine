Package Project:
Some points:

If you use unreferenced blueprints/objects, you should add them a) using command line or b) by creating a level with all the objects you need to publish in your game (not recomended)
Cooking is the proccess of removing unwanted files from your final build
You can choose to Pak (like zip) all your content into a single file
If you are building a dedicated server, you need to have the compiled version of Unreal or will not work.
You will find the RunUAT at UnrealEngine/Engine/Build/BatchFiles
Add the command -build if you're using Source Version from Github
If the -allmaps flag is used, [AllMaps] with valid +Map=\Game\Maps\Map.umap syntax should be added to DefaultEditor.ini
Specific maps can be built (must remove -allmaps flag) using the -maps=Map1+Map2+Map3
