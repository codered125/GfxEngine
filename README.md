# GfxEngine

Decided to make this public, currently my ongoing project
Engine is currently has the following features implemented:

HDR
Directional, Point, and Spot lighting (Blinn/Phong)
Mesh importing (currently best supporting obj)
Texture Loading (best supporting mtls)
Frame buffers / Post Processing effects
Fragment / Vertex shader importing
Multisample anti-aliasing (4-16)

The next feature i'm working on is the conversion to Physics Based Rendering (PBR);
