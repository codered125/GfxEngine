Decided to make this public, currently my ongoing project.

Engine is currently has the following features implemented:

- [x] HDR
- [x] Directional, Point, and Spot lighting (Blinn/Phong)
- [x] Mesh importing (currently best supporting obj)
- [x] Texture Loading (best supporting mtls)
- [x] Frame buffers / Post Processing effects
- [x] Fragment / Vertex shader importing
- [x] Multisample anti-aliasing (4-16)

- [ ] The next feature i'm working on is the conversion to Physics Based Rendering (PBR);
